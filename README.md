Machine Learning Interpretation for Identification of Cis-Regulatory Elements.

A Supervised Deep Learning Model trained on 5'UTR Reporter Sequence from a Massively Parallel Reporter Assay (Sample et. al 2019) will be used for identification of 5'UTR sequence elements that determine ribosome load, and hence, translation outcome. For this purpose, we applied Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et. al 2017), a gradient-based attribution method that assesses the importance of individul features for prediction outcome.
