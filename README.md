Investigating Translation Regulation at the 5'UTR with Machine Learning Interpretation

A recent convolutional neural network (CNN) model accurately quantifies the relationship between 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) sequence and translation phenotype, but the underlying biological determinants remain elusive. Applying model interpretation, we extract representations of regulatory logic, revealing a complex interplay of regulatory sequence elements. Guided by insights from model interpretation, we train a model with superior performance on human reporter data, which will promote applications in synthetic biology and precision medicine.
