Machine Learning Interpretation for Identification of Cis-Regulatory Elements.

A Supervised Deep Learning Model trained on 5'UTR Reporters Sequence Information from a Parallel Reporter Assay (Sample et. al) will be used for identification of sequence elements determining translation outcome. For this purpose, Integrated Gradients (Sundararajan et. al) will be applied to assess feature importance of individual nucleotides.
